Today I created this page. Due to the special circumstances of the matter, I will update this after either when BT young scientist goes live or I upload my progress report, 
whichever comes sooner. I may or may not paste some of my reports here, as most of them consists of failed attempts, over-ambitious or otherwise unrealistic plans and multiple
mental breakdowns. I did not take it easy, and I don't think I should have.
